1)CSS Box Model:

In CSS, every element on a webpage is treated as a rectangular box.
The box model explains how the size of that box is calculated and how elements interact with each other.

2)Components:

1. Content

The actual text, image, or data inside the element.

Example: the words inside a <p> tag.

You can set its size with width and height.

2. Padding

The space between the content and the border.

It makes the content look less cramped.

Example:    p {
                padding: 10px;
            }

Adds 10px space inside the border, around the text.

3. Border

The edge that wraps around the content and padding.

You can style it with thickness, color, and type.

Example:    div {
                border: 2px solid black;
            }

Creates a 2px solid black border around the element.

4. Margin

The space outside the border, separating the element from others.

Example:    h1 {
                margin: 20px;
            }

Adds 20px space outside the element, pushing it away from neighbors.
