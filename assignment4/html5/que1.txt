Difference b/w HTML & HTML5?

--> HTML : -> HTML is the earlier version of the language used to create webpages.
           -> It had limited features and relied on external plugins for audio, video, and animations.
           -> It also lacked semantic tags and had basic form controls with limited input types.
           -> Data storage was done using cookies only.

--> HTML5 : -> HTML5 is the latest version with many improvements.
            -> It supports built-in audio and video tags, new semantic elements like <header> and <footer>, and modern form inputs like email and date.
            -> It also includes local and session storage, better performance, and is designed to work well on mobile device and modern browsers.
