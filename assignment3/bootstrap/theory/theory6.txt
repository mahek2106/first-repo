2. Purpose of utility classes in Bootstrap (with examples)

Utility classes are small, ready-made classes that let you quickly style elements without writing extra CSS.
They help in fast design and consistent look.


Examples:

Spacing: m-3 (margin), p-4 (padding)

Text: text-center, fw-bold (bold text), text-danger (red text)

Display: d-flex, d-none

Colors: bg-primary, text-white
