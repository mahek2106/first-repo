2. Explain the Bootstrap grid system and how it helps create responsive layouts.

The grid system in Bootstrap divides the page into 12 equal parts (columns).
We can use these columns to arrange content in rows and sections.

Example:

.col-6 → takes half (6 out of 12 columns).
.col-4 → takes one-third (4 out of 12 columns).

It helps make websites responsive because:

On big screens, content shows side by side.
On small screens, content stacks on top of each other.
