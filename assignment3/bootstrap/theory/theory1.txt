1. What is Bootstrap, and why is it useful for website design?

Bootstrap is a free tool (framework) that helps us design websites quickly.
It already has ready-made styles for things like buttons, forms, navigation bars, and layouts.

It is useful because:

Saves time (no need to write all CSS from scratch).
Makes websites look good on all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, laptop).
Keeps the design clean and consistent.
