What is Utility-First CSS?

Utility-first CSS means using small, single-purpose classes to style elements directly in your HTML.
Each class does only one job (like set text color, margin, or background).
Instead of writing custom CSS rules, you combine these small classes to design your webpage.


Example (Tailwind CSS):

<p class="text-red-500 text-center p-4">Hello, I am styled with utility classes!</p>


Here:

text-red-500 = red text
text-center = center align
p-4 = padding


Advantages of Utility-First CSS

i)Faster development → No need to write extra CSS files, just use ready-made classes.

ii)Consistent design → Same spacing, colors, and sizes across the website.

iii)Less custom CSS → Reduces messy CSS code, since most styles come from utilities.

iv)Easier to maintain → If you want to change a style, you just change the class in HTML (no searching in CSS files).

v)Highly customizable → You can mix and match classes to create your own unique design.
