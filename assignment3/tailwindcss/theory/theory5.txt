Responsive Design with Tailwind Breakpoints

Responsive design means your website looks good on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
Tailwind makes this easy using breakpoints (short codes for screen sizes).
You add these before a class name to apply styles only on certain screen sizes.


Tailwind’s default breakpoints:

sm → small screens (≥640px)

md → medium screens (≥768px)

lg → large screens (≥1024px)

xl → extra-large (≥1280px)

2xl → very large (≥1536px)


Example 1: Responsive text size

<p class="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
  This text grows bigger on larger screens.
</p>

Mobile → small text
Tablet → medium text
Desktop → large text


Example 2: Responsive layout (grid)

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-4">
  <div class="bg-blue-200 p-4">Box 1</div>
  <div class="bg-blue-300 p-4">Box 2</div>
  <div class="bg-blue-400 p-4">Box 3</div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 p-4">Box 4</div>
</div>

On mobile → 1 column
On tablet → 2 columns
On desktop → 4 columns
