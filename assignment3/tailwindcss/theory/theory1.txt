What is Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS is a modern CSS framework that helps you design websites quickly.
Instead of giving you ready-made components (like Bootstrap’s navbar or buttons), Tailwind gives you utility classes (small, single-purpose classes).
You combine these classes directly in your HTML to style elements.


Example:

<button class="bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded">Click Me</button>


Here:

bg-blue-500 = blue background
text-white = white text
px-4 py-2 = padding
rounded = rounded corners



How Tailwind is different from traditional CSS frameworks (like Bootstrap):

i)Utility-first → Tailwind uses small utility classes (text-center, bg-red-500) instead of pre-designed components.

ii)Highly customizable → You control the design (colors, spacing, fonts) easily in the Tailwind config.

iii)No fixed design → Bootstrap gives a default "Bootstrap look," but Tailwind has no fixed style – your website looks unique.

iv)Less custom CSS needed → Since you style directly in HTML, you write very little extra CSS.
